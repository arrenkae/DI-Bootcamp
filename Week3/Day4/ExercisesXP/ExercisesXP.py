# Exercise 1 – Random Sentence Generator

# Description: In this exercise we will create a random sentence generator. We will do this by asking the user how long the sentence should be and then printing the generated sentence.

# Hint : The generated sentences do not have to make sense.

#     Download this word list

#     Save it in your development directory.

#     Create a function called get_words_from_file. This function should read the file’s content and return the words as a collection. What is the correct data type to store the words?

#     Create another function called get_random_sentence which takes a single parameter called length. The length parameter will be used to determine how many words the sentence should have. The function should:
#         use the words list to get your random words.
#         the amount of words should be the value of the length parameter.

#     Take the random words and create a sentence (using a python method), the sentence should be lower case.

#     Create a function called main which will:
#         Print a message explaining what the program does.

#         Ask the user how long they want the sentence to be. Acceptable values are: an integer between 2 and 20. Validate your data and test your validation!
#             If the user inputs incorrect data, print an error message and end the program.
#             If the user inputs correct data, run your code.

# Exercise 2: Working with JSON
# Instructions

# Access the nested “salary” key from the JSON-string above.
# Add a key called “birth_date” to the JSON-string at the same level as the “name” key.
# Save the dictionary as JSON to a file.
